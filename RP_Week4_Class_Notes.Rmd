## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





## Week 4 - Simulation and Profiling

* calling the str function on an arbitrary R object

*describing the difference between the "by.self" and "by.total" output produced by the R profiler

*simulating a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation

*simulating data from a normal linear model

##MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN R - str()

supposed to compactly display the internal structure of an R object.

roughly one line per basic object

a diagnostic function and an alternative to summary()

"what's in this object?"

```{r}
str(str)

str(lm)
```

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100, 2, 4)

summary(x)

str(x)

f<- gl(40, 10)

str(f)

summary(f)

library(datasets)

head(airquality)

str(airquality)

m <- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)

str(m)

m[, 1]

s<- split(airquality, airquality$Month)

str(s)



```

## SIMULATION - Generating Random Numbers

rnorm : generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation

dnorm: evaluate the Normal probability density(with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points)

pnorm: evaluate the cumulative distributive function for a Normal distribution

rpois: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate


d for density

r for random number generation

p for cumulative distribution

q for quantile function


every distribution has these four types of function


* if phi is the cumulative distribution for a standard Normal distribution, then pnorm(q) = phi(q) and qnorm(p)= phi^-1(p)

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x

x<- rnorm(10, 20, 2)

summary(x)

set.seed(1)

rnorm(5)


```

when you generate random numbers in a pc, they are not random.

they are sudo random numbers.

setting random number seed with set.seed ensures reproducibility

```{r}
set.seed(1)

rnorm(5)

rnorm(5) #gives different result

#but if you set the seed again

set.seed(1)

rnorm(5) # you get the same answer.


```


Generating Poisson data

```{r}
rpois(10, 1)

rpois(10, 2)

rpois(10, 20)

ppois(2, 2) #Pr(x <= 2)

ppois(4, 2) # Pr(x <= 4)

ppois(6, 2) # Pr(x <= 6)


```


## Simulating a Linear Model

```{r}
set.seed(20)

x <- rnorm(100) # predictor

e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2) #noise

y <- 0.5 + 2 *x + e 

summary(y)

plot(x, y)


```

what if x is a binary random variable, instead of a Normal random variable (gender, or treatment group, etc.)

```{r}
set.seed(10)

x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)

e <- rnorm(100, 0, 2) # noise

y <- 0.5 + 2*x + e

summary(y)

plot(x, y)
```

suppose we want to simulate from a Poisson model

maybe an outcome data with count variables instead of continuous variables.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

x <- rnorm(100) # standard Normal distribution

log.mu <- 0.5 + 0.3 * x #log of mean mu

y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu))

summary(y)

plot(x, y)

```


## Random Sampling

sample() function

draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing you to sample from arbitrary distributions

```{r}
set.seed(1)

sample(1:10, 4)

sample(1:10, 4)

sample(letters, 5)

sample(1:10) # permutation

sample(1:10, replace = TRUE) # sample w/ replacement

```
